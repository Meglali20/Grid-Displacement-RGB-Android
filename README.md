# Grid-Displacement-RGB-Android
An OpenGL implementation of a grid-based displacement texture effect with an interactive RGB shift, inspired by the original effect created in Three.js. 

This project demonstrates a creative use of framebuffers and shaders to achieve a dynamic, interactive displacement effect with subtle RGB shifting, driven touch movement.
Original Three.js version can be found [here](https://tympanus.net/Development/GridDistortionEffect/).

This project recreates a grid-based displacement effect with an RGB shift using OpenGL. It relies on frameBuffers for offscreen rendering and getting previous shader result.
